          <h1>ASSOCIATION OF AGENCIES (AOA)</h1>
          <h2>Purpose &amp; Organization</h2>
          <p>The Association of Agencies is a group of agencies that meet on a regular basis to discuss Disability Issues relating to the local community. This group is facilitated through Miami Dade College's Wolfson Campus ACCESS Services Department.</p>
          <p>The mission of this Association is to post the knowledge and resources of service agencies to improve the lives of individuals with disabilities. The members have agreed to six levels of activity.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Networking</strong>: First and foremost, it was recognized that it was very important for those from diverse agencies, even those that might be competing agencies, to get to know each other, know how each served a very unique and useful purpose for certain individuals with disabilities in various parts of the county. It was suggested that if the Association became successful in its mission, chapters in other areas could be encouraged. Recognizing that various disability issues are different throughout such a large county, it was suggested that it might be best to begin the Association as a "Central" or "Downtown" Association addressing concerns that are more focused and relevant to a specific area. The networking of agencies, however, would eventually lead to expansion to satellite agencies that can be developed in other parts of the community.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Presentations &amp; Training</strong>: Once the participants get to know each other and how to more effectively communicate and be able to refer more effectively, it was recognized that each agency would need to fully clarify its role to others. It is possible that one or more agencies could make a presentation at meetings. It was also recognized that training opportunities could be featured when there were identified needs across agencies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Open Forum</strong>: Building upon networking and knowledge could be an open forum where issues are raised and freely discussed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Focus Group</strong>: Utilizing all or part or the memberships, initiate focus groups to more clearly define common problems and how to channel resources that address these problems. [This related to the proposal by the outgoing coordinator of the Alliance for Human Services to utilize the Association as an important focus group to identify issues that needed significant funding.]</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Solutions</strong>: All or part of the membership could work together to develop solutions that could improve all levels of identifying and providing better services to persons with disabilities. Whether this related to solving some very specific problems for identified individuals or related to problems that were broad in scope were identified as potential options.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Grants</strong>: Perhaps the most constructive aspect of the Association would be in identifying and cooperatively pursuing grants that could improve awareness and moving action along at a faster pace [The issue of a community web page exclusively for persons with disabilities might be useful.]</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Projected Meeting Schedules: The AOA meets every First Thursday of the month.</strong></p>

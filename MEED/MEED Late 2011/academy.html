			<a name="top"></a><h1 class="Page_Title">The MEED Academy</h1>
			<p>Today the MEED Program continues to provide academic support 
			(e.g., program monitoring, mentoring, career mapping, etc.) for 
			students in diverse technical certificate and degree programs, but 
			has now returned to its original model of emphasizing training in 
			advanced technology and has added an Academy in which students apply 
			academic training in service and internship experiences and a 
			Professional Studies Institute in which students master 
			employability skills and receive professional skills training from 
			experts in business and industry. Those who complete the MEED 
			Academy will receive a MEED Endorsement, awarded to students who 
			have not only completed Program components but who have mastered 
			technical and professional skills and are recommended for 
			competitive employment. </p>
			<p>Originally MEED was an acronym for "Microcomputer Education for 
			the Employment of the Disabled;" however, some of these terms now 
			need to be updated, and we now refer to the MEED Program as a "Model 
			for Enhanced Employment Development." This designation points to the 
			Program's advanced approach to professional development and its 
			potential to become a national model employment program for 
			individuals with disabilities, and indeed anyone who wants a 
			comprehensive and advanced professional skills training program. The 
			MEED Program is now constructed upon the principles of universal 
			design and therefore intended to be a program that is accessible to 
			any adult looking for advanced employment/professional training 
			experiences and opportunities. MEED-sponsored seminars and courses 
			may be available to individuals without disabilities when space is 
			available. The MEED Program works with a community network of 
			agencies including the Business Leadership Network (BLN) and all 
			South Florida AmeriCorps agencies and the Association of Agencies 
			(AOA) to improve awareness of 
			the abilities of persons with disabilities and develop a new climate 
			of employment opportunities in our community. </p>

			<h2><a name="eligibility"></a>Eligibility</h2>
			<p>Individuals who are eligible for the MEED Program must be (1) adults 
			with a documented disability, who (2) function independently and are 
			personally committed to obtaining employment with advanced technical 
			training, and (3) are otherwise qualified for advanced vocational or 
			college-level training (minimum achievement levels meet the entry 
			requirements for academic programs - minimum 6th grade in reading, 
			language, and mathematics for vocational programs; completion of all 
			college prep courses for students in college-level programs), (4) 
			agree to participate in at least one service learning course per 
			academic year as well as internship experiences (paid or unpaid), 
			and (5) agree to participate in professional and technological 
			skills training, as well as campus and off-campus experiences and 
			training supported or sponsored by the MEED Program until completion 
			of a vocational or college credit certificate or an associate of 
			science degree. Additionally, prospective students will be required 
			to obtain background checks at their expense. Any psychological 
			disorder that could affect performance in the work environment must 
			be under professional management, and students may be asked to 
			provide medical documentation to that effect. Individuals with 
			disabilities who are not immediately eligible may enroll at the 
			College through the ACCESS Department and register for those 
			programs for which the student is eligible to receive skills 
			training, adult basic education, a GED program, or Community 
			Education courses that can prepare the student to eventually meet 
			the eligibility requirements of the MEED Program.</p>
			<p>Students for Whom the MEED Program May be Appropriate</p>
			<ul class="ULMetro">
				<li>Individuals who have been employed or have degrees but may need 
				re-training due to an acquired disability</li>
				<li>Individuals who are college-ready but may have been receiving 
				Social Security benefits</li>
				<li>Individuals who are college-ready but may be a returning veteran 
				with a disability</li>
				<li>Individuals with disabilities who are college-ready and who have 
				demonstrated potential in advanced technology areas. </li>
			</ul>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="fees"></a>Fees</h2>
			<p>Students who are eligible for the MEED Program must work with a 
			referring agency to obtain all necessary financial aid necessary to 
			complete an academic program unless they are able to find 
			scholarships or other financial resources to meet course, books and 
			materials as well as Program fees. The MEED Program does not process 
			financial aid or financial aid documents unless a student needs an 
			accommodation (e.g., a sign language interpreter) for any part of 
			financial aid assistance through Miami Dade College. There is an 
			additional fee attached to all courses for which students are 
			registered. These fees are standard for one academic year but are 
			subject to change with each new academic year. </p>
			<p>Some College scholarships may be available to students, and 
			eligibility must be processed through the financial aid office at 
			the local campus.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="referral"></a>Referral and Academic Program Placement</h2>
			<p>Once a student has been referred to the MEED Program by a referring 
			agency (e.g., the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, the 
			Division of Blind Services, etc.), the MEED Program staff work with 
			the referring agency to determine the most appropriate academic 
			program. Students may register for courses on any of the eight 
			campuses.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="advisement"></a>Advisement, Registration and Accommodations</h2>
			<p>Students with disabilities first meet with an advisor from the 
			ACCESS Department and receive assistance with registration and 
			accommodations. The MEED Program will provide additional academic 
			support services once a student has been determined eligible and has 
			signed the MEED Program Agreement for Participation. This agreement 
			allows the student to be fully aware of all the additional 
			requirements that are above and beyond the academic program.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="meed_academy_components"></a>The MEED Academy Components</h2>
			<p>The MEED Academy program includes the following components:</p>
			<h2><a name="mentoring"></a>Mentoring</h2>
			<p>Upon enrollment in the MEED Academy, students are assigned a mentor 
			who will become very knowledgeable regarding the student’s abilities 
			and assist the student to determine how these can be used to enhance 
			success in the Program as well as improve personal employability and 
			professionalism. Mentors will work with Program instructors, ACCESS 
			resource advisors and the Internship Coordinator to ensure that the 
			mentee is able to maintain progress and make personal growth.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="service_learning"></a>Service Learning</h2>
			<p>Students will be registered through a campus ACCESS Advisor who will 
			work with the student to determine accommodations, and during an 
			academic year assist MEED students to register for at least one 
			course that incorporates service learning as part of the curriculum. 
			The MEED Program recognizes that service-learning experiences are 
			uniquely valuable in motivating and preparing students with 
			disabilities and broadens personal, social, and professional skills 
			and abilities that can lead to important employment possibilities.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="internships"></a>Internships</h2>
			<p>All MEED students will be required to participate in at least one 
			unpaid internship whether or not it is part of their academic 
			program; however, they will also be encouraged to participate in 
			additional internships paid or unpaid if appropriate to the training 
			needs of the student and the requirements of the academic program. 
			Student will work with an Internship Coordinator who will develop 
			the internship assignment with the student. The MEED Program is 
			committed to the value of experience in fully preparing students 
			with disabilities for competitive employment opportunities.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="special_activities"></a>Special Activities</h2>
			<p>MEED Program students are encouraged to become active in campus and 
			community organizations that address disability issues and promote 
			awareness of the abilities of all individuals with disabilities. 
			Students may join the Abilities Awareness &amp; Recognition Council 
			(AARC) on the Wolfson Campus or another student organization at 
			their respective campus, visit the Commission on Disability Issues 
			(CODI) or the Association of Agencies Serving Persons with 
			Disabilities (AASPD) or become a member of these. Each of these 
			organizations provides opportunities to learn about diverse 
			community resources and programs and allows the student to become 
			engaged in community service projects.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_Professional_Studies_Institute"></a>The Professional Studies Institute</h2>
			<p>Each semester, the MEED Academy will sponsor a Professional Skills 
			Institute which can include a series of workshops or seminars 
			sponsored by College faculty and staff or representatives from 
			business and industry in the community. In some cases, the series 
			will include courses for which the student will need to register.</p>			
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="Digital_Technology_and_the_Academy"></a>Digital Technology and the Academy</h2>						
			<p>As part of the Professional Skills Institute, all MEED Academy 
			students will be required to participate in a digital technology 
			training program to integrate this technology within professional 
			skills learned through the Professional Skills Institute (e.g., 
			students will use iPods as essential devices for organizing 
			schedules, contacts, and maintaining priorities as well as download 
			informational and skill modules through iTunesU; all students will 
			use MacBook laptops to create presentations and build portfolios as 
			well as connect with internet resources related to career and 
			employment opportunities and much more). Additionally, students will 
			need to be trained to take advantage of the accessibility features 
			of this technology as a means of improving professional performance 
			for employment purposes.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="Personal_Development_Recreation_and_Leisure"></a>Personal Development, Recreation and Leisure</h2>
			<p>All MEED Program students will be encouraged to participate in 
			campus organizations on their respective campuses. This 
			participation can be with either a disabilities or other student 
			organization. </p>
			<p>To assist students to balance the comprehensive training needs of 
			the MEED Program with personal and social development issues that 
			also support improved employability skills, students will also be 
			assisted to develop a recreation/leisure component of their 
			training. This component can include participation at Shake-a-Leg 
			Miami, a recreation and leisure program sponsored by the City or 
			County Parks and Recreation Department, or other special 
			recreation/leisure experience sponsored by the Campus or College. 
			All recreation and leisure components will be developed with a view 
			to accessibility.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_Employment_Assistance_Program"></a>The Employment Assistance Program</h2>
			<p>Enrolled students will be able to take advantage of the Employment 
			Assistance staff who will meet with students from the beginning of 
			their program to access employment and professional skills as well 
			as broad assistance to address issues that affect employment. The 
			MEED Program works closely with many business and industry leaders 
			to continue to develop new opportunities for the highly trained MEED 
			graduate.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_MEED_Program_and_the_Community"></a>The MEED Program and the Community</h2>
			<p>As it prepares individuals with disabilities for competitive 
			employment opportunities, the MEED Program will work closely with 
			the community to build awareness of the abilities of individuals 
			with disabilities and help create new employment opportunities 
			whenever possible.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_Business_Advisory_Council_BAC"></a>The Business Advisory Council (BAC)</h2>
			<p>Members of business and industry have been selected by Miami Dade 
			College to advise the MEED Program staff and link program 
			effectiveness to the needs of employers throughout the community.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_Association_of_Agencies_AOA"></a>The Association of Agencies (AOA)</h2>
			<p>Each month the MEED Program hosts a meeting of over 35 different 
			community agencies that either directly or indirectly provides 
			services to persons with disabilities. Many of these agencies are 
			committed to improving employment opportunities and sharing 
			knowledge that also address diverse issues that can affect 
			employment (e.g., transportation, housing, medical benefits, etc.). 
			All South Florida AmeriCorps agencies are invited to participate and 
			partner with these agencies and work with us to develop 
			inclusiveness of opportunities in the South Florida market.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="Commitment_to_the_Principles_of_Universal_Design"></a>Commitment to the Principles of Universal Design</h2>
			<p>The MEED Program and many similar programs are possible because of 
			the federal, state, and local laws as well as College initiatives 
			that promote accessibility. However, the MEED Program is also 
			committed to the principles of universal design which address much 
			broader issues that improve employment and other life opportunities 
			by considering the diverse needs of individuals whether those 
			diverse needs are a result of disability, age, or many other factors 
			that affect full inclusion in life’s most important opportunities. 
			Universal design principles promote not only accessibility for all 
			but flexible and sustainable environments and experiences that 
			significantly address diversity.</p>
			<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
			<h2><a name="The_MEED_Staff"></a>The MEED Staff</h2>
			<p>The MEED staff includes a Director, an Academic Support 
			Coordinator, an Employment Outreach Coordinator, an Employment 
			Assistance Specialist, an Internship Coordinator, as well as 
			technical support staff. The MEED staff work closely with the ACCESS 
			Department to address accommodations and other accessibility issues 
			and works closely with the MDC Employment and Career areas and many 
			other Student Services Departments. Staff also collaborates with MDC 
			faculty to develop special learning materials and resources. 
			Eventually, it is proposed that the MEED Academy will sponsor 
			selected courses that will be infused with additional training 
			opportunities to further develop employment opportunities.</p>
